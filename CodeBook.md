Files used: subject-test.txt, X-test.txt, y-test.txt, subject_train.txt, x-train.txt, y-train.txt, activity-labels.txt, features.txt

###Data collected
Feature vaiables (see below) were collected for 30 test persons (Subjects) performing 6 activities (WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, LAYING, STANDING).

###Variables: Features measured
Raw signals captured from accelerometer and gyroscope are denoted Acc-XYZ and Gyro-XYZ (suffix -XYZ denoting 3-axial). prefix t- denotes time (time domain signals). The acceleration signal was further divided into body (BodyAcc-XYZ) and gravity (GravityAcc-XYZ) signals. Jerk signals were derived from body linear acceleration (BodyAccJerk-XYZ) and angular velocity (BodyGyroJerk-XYZ).The magnitude of the signals were measured, denoted with a suffix -mag.A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was also applied, denoted with prefix f-. A list of all signals captured:
* tBodyAcc-XYZ
* tGravityAcc-XYZ
* tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* tBodyGyro-XYZ
* tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
* tBodyAccMag
* tGravityAccMag
* tBodyAccJerkMag
* tBodyGyroMag
* tBodyGyroJerkMag
* fBodyAcc-XYZ
* fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* fBodyGyro-XYZ
* fBodyAccMag
* fBodyAccJerkMag
* fBodyGyroMag
* BodyGyroJerkMag

variables for the above-mentioned signals used in this analysis (a subset of the original analysis) are mean and standard deviation values.

Additional mean values were captured by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These were denoted as follows:
* gravityMean
* tBodyAccMean
* tBodyAccJerkMean
* tBodyGyroMean
* tBodyGyroJerkMean

The total sum of features in this subset is 86.

###Data cleaning process
The first part of the script reads data from the files described in README.md (set to working directory "/Users/camilla/Documents/R/UCI HAR Dataset/..."

Rows are merged rowwise with rbind-function
Column headers names are given with names()

Activity labels are clarified in plain text within the "Activity"-column with ex. ColActivities$V1[ColActivities$V1 == 1] <- "WALKING"

Features Headers are extracted from column 2 in the file features.txt and added after the rowmerging procedure.

The 3 created column parts (Subjects, Activities and Features) are merged into one table with cbind.

A table with only mean and standard deviation values of features is created with grep, searching for Subjects OR Activities OR mean OR std.

This table is recasted using melt/dcast to get the feature mean values for each Subject and each Activity (a total of 180 rows)

This table is written to a csv-file, TidyData, which is the one uploaded on the course site.
