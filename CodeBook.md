Data
30 test persons (subjects) performing 6 activities (WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, LAYING, STANDING)
Variables
Features measured
Raw signals captured from accelerometer and gyroscope are denoted Acc-XYZ and Gyro-XYZ (XYZ for 3-axial). prefix t- denotes time (time domain signals). The acceleration signal was further divided into body (BodyAcc-XYZ) and gravity (GravityAcc-XYZ) signals. Jerk signals were derived from body linear acceleration (BodyAccJerk-XYZ) and angular velocity (BodyGyroJerk-XYZ).The magnitude of the signals were measured, denoted with a suffix -mag.A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was also applied, denoted with prefix f-. A list of all signals captured:
tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

variables for the above-mentioned signals used in this analysis are mean and standard deviation values.

Additional mean values were captured by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These were denoted as follows:
gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
